The folder structure is as follows:
- `data` contains all of the raw and processed data required to perform the analyses reported.
- `tutorials` contains notebooks demonstrating how to reproduce the results reported in the main text.
- `figures` contains notebooks that generate the figures used in the main text.
- `analyses` contains notebooks that reproduce the results produced in the supporting information, which are not needed for a core understanding of how the data / models were generated.

Each folder contains its own README which gives a brief overview of the files in that directory.
