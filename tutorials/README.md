The notebooks contained in this directory are:

- `Filtering VSSE vs HFX Curves.ipynb`:
  - Filters the datasets to remove any points or structures that do not yield smooth VSSE vs. HFX curves.
- `IP Tuning Targets.ipynb`:
  - Determines the best single HFX as to match the fundamental gap to the HOMO-LUMO gap. Generates data for the tuned approach. Also shows the dataset sizes after filtering out structures with insufficient converged calculations.
